shortDescription: Interact with Helm repositories and charts via MCP
description: |
  An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools for interacting with Helm repositories and charts. This server enables AI assistants to query Helm repositories, retrieve chart information, and access chart values without requiring local Helm installation.

  The purpose of using MCP for Helm is to avoid making up format of `values.yaml` and contents of the charts when working with LLMs. Instead, the server provides a standardized way to access this information, making it easier for AI assistants to interact with Helm charts and repositories.

  This MCP server provides tools for working with Helm repositories only. If you need to work with other Kubernetes resources, consider using a separate MCP server that provides tools for Kubernetes resources.

  ## Features
  - **list_repository_charts** - Lists all charts available in a Helm repository (or chart name for OCI registries)
  - **list_chart_versions** - Lists all available versions/tags for a chart
  - **get_latest_version_of_chart** - Retrieves the latest version of a specific chart
  - **get_chart_values** - Retrieves the values file for a chart (latest version or specific version)
  - **get_chart_contents** - Retrieves the contents of a chart (including templates, values, and metadata)
  - **get_chart_dependencies** - Retrieves the dependencies of a chart as defined in its `Chart.yaml` file
  - **get_chart_images** - Extracts container images used in a Helm chart by rendering templates and parsing Kubernetes manifests

  ### Repository Types

  All tools support both traditional HTTP Helm repositories and OCI registries:

  | Repository Type  | Example URL                        |
  |------------------|------------------------------------|
  | HTTP Repository  | `https://charts.example.com`       |
  | OCI Registry     | `oci://ghcr.io/org/charts/mychart` |
  | OCI (Docker Hub) | `oci://docker.io/library/mysql`    |
